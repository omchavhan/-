                                            <p>Most Indians lose money in trading because they use their gut feeling, rather than a system. Indians love to speculate in the stock markets but unfortunately fail to learn the lesson. That is the reason we created the FINDAS NIFTY FUTURES TRADING MODEL. This is a system based on mathematical logic and it has been back tested till 2009.
                                            <a class="read-more-show hide readmore" href="javascript:void(0)" id="5" style="width:100%;">Read More</a> <span class="read-more-content">The aim of this model is to beat the bank FD returns by a margin of 3 to 5 times. So if the bank FD returns are 7% per annum, this model is expected to deliver anywhere between 21% to 35% per annum. The trading is done in Nifty futures. Few advantages - One makes money when market goes up and when market goes down, no prior knowledge of trading is required, no need to watch the markets continuously - just 15 mins per day and you are done, no analysis required you just need to follow the system and count your profits. Watch this video to know how to use the FINDAS NIFTY FUTURES TRADING MODEL - <a style="display:block; width:100% margin:5px auto; color:blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJP0fivz18I" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/AJP0fivz18I</a> Use this link to access and use the FINDAS NIFTY FUTURES TRADING MODEL..
